## Progress

| Task | Progress | Challenges
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---- |

| Create a build job specification | In Progress | Understanding how to design, and how this will influence the next step.

So far, we have completed most of the task to Automatically provision and configure a build server on both M1 and Windows environments.

This first task was done in two separate branches for M1 and Windows, and then merged. This is mostly completed, apart from slight modifications later depending on any additions we deem necessary going forward.

For the second task, which is Create a build job specification, this is currently in progress. We have also completed the checkpoint report for this milestone.

## Challenges

- Understanding how to work with the .env file, and what constraints to enforce - like IP, VM name etc

- Understanding how to design and work with YAML, and how this will influence the next step.

## Work Remaining

We need to complete our work on the second task, which is the job specification before moving on the third and largest task, Automatically configure a build environment for given build job specification.

After this, we still have to work on a screencast, write the milestone report and test our work.
